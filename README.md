#### Key Features:
- **TCP/IP Communication**: The system features two separate modules communicating over TCP/IP using socket programming, simulating the control of household devices.
- **Modular Design**: The first module simulates a control keypad and device status interface, while the second module provides a diagrammatic representation of the device statuses.
- **User Interface**: A well-designed front panel provides users with clear and intuitive control over various devices, including on/off switches, volume control, and picture adjustments.
- **Software Sensor Simulation**: Although hardware sensors are not used, the system includes simulated sensors, which could be replaced with physical devices in a future iteration.
  
#### AI and Machine Learning Integration:
This project lays the groundwork for future AI integration. In future iterations, machine learning algorithms can be implemented to enhance the automation of smart home devices, allowing the system to learn from user behavior and preferences, optimizing energy usage, and improving user experience.
